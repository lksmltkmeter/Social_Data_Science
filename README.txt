README

This repo documents the code used for the Exam project for the course "Introduction to Social Data Science" at the University of Copenhagen (see: https://kurser.ku.dk/course/a√òkk08216u). The exam is an open question that challenges students to come up with their own interesting ideas on how to use Data Science, web-scraping or machine learning to answer economic questions. 

The project idea was developed and implemented as a group together by Jacob Hein, Mette Louise Andresen and Lukas Malte Kemeter.

The notebook code does not display the plot for section 10. "Investigating difference in timing of case and unemployment development". The plot is therefore attached as a pdf called "snails.pdf".
